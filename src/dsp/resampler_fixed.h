/* resampler_fixed.h
 *
 * Purpose-built fixed-ratio rational polyphase resampler for the JV-880
 * Move module: 64000 Hz -> 44100 Hz, i.e. interpolate by L=441 and
 * decimate by M=640 (441/640 = 44100/64000 exactly).
 *
 * Replaces libresample (general arbitrary-ratio) in the v2 emu thread.
 * Because the ratio is fixed and rational, every output sample is a single
 * dot product of TAPS_PER_PHASE coefficients selected from a precomputed
 * polyphase bank.  The coefficient table is built once at init in double
 * precision and stored as float.
 *
 * Filter design: windowed-sinc (Kaiser window) lowpass prototype evaluated
 * at the interpolated rate L*Fs_in.  Cutoff sits below the 22.05 kHz output
 * Nyquist with a Kaiser-fitted transition band giving >=70 dB stopband and
 * <=0.1 dB passband ripple to 18 kHz (verified empirically by
 * tools/resampler_test).
 *
 * Header-only.  Plain C++; inner loop written to auto-vectorize.  Optional
 * NEON path guarded by __ARM_NEON with a portable fallback.
 *
 * Thread/RT notes: ResamplerFixed_process() does no allocation and no
 * locking.  State (history line + phase accumulator) is persistent in the
 * instance so it is correct across arbitrarily chunked input.

 * The prototype lowpass runs at the interpolated rate L*Fs_in = 441*64000
 * = 28.224 MHz and has total length N = RF_L * RF_TAPS_PER_PHASE.  Each
 * output sample convolves RF_TAPS_PER_PHASE input samples with one phase.
 *
 * 64 taps/phase.  This is larger than a "typical" 16-32, and the reason is
 * the near-unity ratio: 44100/64000 = 0.689 puts the output Nyquist
 * (22.05 kHz) only just above the 18 kHz passband edge, so the antialiasing
 * lowpass must fall from <=0.1 dB ripple at 18 kHz to >=70 dB by ~24 kHz
 * (the lowest input frequency whose downsampling fold lands inside the
 * audible band, 44100-24000 = 20.1 kHz).  That is a sharp transition.
 * Empirically (see tools/resampler_test and the design sweep):
 *   - 24-32 taps : cannot hold 0.1 dB ripple to 18 kHz AND 70 dB by 24 kHz.
 *   - 48 taps    : ripple ok, but only ~-39 dB at 24 kHz.
 *   - 56 taps    : ripple 0.006 dB, ~-50 dB at 24 kHz, -104 dB at 26 kHz.
 *   - 64 taps    : ripple ~0 dB, ~-67 dB at 24 kHz, full >70 dB from ~24.2k.
 * 64 is the smallest clean power-of-two-friendly choice (multiple of 4 for
 * NEON) that fully meets the spec, and still benchmarks >2x faster than
 * libresample-HQ because the work is one fixed-length dot product per output
 * with no per-sample filter reconstruction.
